# Food-Delivery-Crisis-Impact-and-Crisis-Recovery
Food Delivery Crisis Analysis Dashboard – Power BI project analyzing pre-crisis vs crisis impact using KPIs, customer segments, delivery trends, sentiment analysis, and recovery insights to identify key issues and recommend data-driven recovery strategies.

## 📌 Project Overview
This dashboard explores how a crisis affected a food delivery platform. The aim was to understand:
- What changed during the crisis?
- Which customers and restaurants were most affected?
